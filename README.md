# Game of Life (Cellular Automata)

Live Demo: [https://rencheng0525.github.io/CellularAutomata/](https://rencheng0525.github.io/CellularAutomata/)

Generated by Claude with prompts only, no manual code editing. Took 1 hour.

## Overview
An advanced interactive implementation of Conway's Game of Life with dynamic Voronoi-based visualization. The project allows users to experiment with cellular automata using various patterns and control options.

## Features

### Visual Components
- **Voronoi-Based Grid**: Cells are represented as Voronoi regions for an organic, fluid-like appearance.
- **Dynamic Color Scheme**: Each cell has a randomized color for better visualization.
- **Responsive Canvas**: Adjusts size based on available screen space.

### Simulation Mechanics
- **Classic Game of Life Rules**: Supports birth and survival conditions for cells.
- **Predefined Patterns**: Select from various classic patterns like Glider, Spaceships, and Oscillators.
- **Random Generation**: Initialize the grid with a randomized state.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust animation speed dynamically.

### Interactive Features
- **Pattern Selection**: Load predefined patterns via a dropdown menu.
- **Grid Size Adjustment**: Customize the grid dimensions.
- **Click Interaction**: Toggle individual cells by clicking on the canvas.
- **Playback Controls**: Start, pause, and reset the simulation.

## Technical Highlights
- Built using **D3.js** for Voronoi-based visualization.
- Handles real-time interaction using JavaScript event listeners.
- Optimized rendering for smooth animations and efficient updates.

## Usage
1. Open the live demo link in a modern desktop browser.
2. Use the controls to select a pattern, adjust speed, and modify grid size.
3. Click on cells to manually toggle their state.
4. Press **Play** to run the simulation.

## Browser Support
- Works on **modern desktop browsers** with JavaScript enabled.
- **Not supported on mobile devices** due to performance constraints.
